parameters :
  alignment_object_ref :
    ui-name : |
        Reads Alignment Set
    short-hint : |
        Select the reads alignment or reads alignment set created by aligners such as Bowtie2, TopHat2, or HISAT2.
  genome_ref :
    ui-name : |
        Genome

  min_intron_length :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Intron Length

    ui-name : |
      Expression Suffix
    short-hint : |
      Provide a suffix for the expression output object names.

    <p>This App assembles transcripts for a given sample or a sample set using Cufflinks and generates an Expression object for each individual sample and an ExpressionSet object for the sample set. The user can view the relative abundances of the assembled transcripts in a histogram, also generated by this App.</p>

    <p>It accepts aligned RNA-seq reads from aligners such as Bowtie2, TopHat2, or HISAT2 and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. It then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.</p>

    <p>This App also provides the normalized expression matrices which contain the abundance of each transcript expressed in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) and transcripts per million (TPM). The FPKM Histogram tab in the Cufflinks table displays the abundance of normalized gene expression value log2(FPKM+1) whereas the TPM Histogram tab displays the abundance of normalized gene expression value log2(TPM+1).</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This App is one of the steps in the <a href= "http://kbase.us/expression-analysis/">Transcriptomics and Expression Analysis Workflow</a> in KBase, however it can also be run as a standalone for one or more RNA-seq samples.</p>

    <p><strong>Team members who developed & deployed algorithm in KBase:</strong> Srividya Ramakrishnan, Sunita Kumari, Shinjae Yoo, Priya Ranjan, Jim Thomason, and Vivek Kumar. For questions, please <a href=”http://kbase.us/contact-us”>contact us</a>.</p>
