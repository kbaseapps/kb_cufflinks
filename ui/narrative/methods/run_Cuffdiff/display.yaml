parameters :
  expressionset_ref :
    ui-name : |
      Expression Set
    short-hint : |
      Select the expression set associated with transcripts assembled by Cufflinks or Stringtie
  input_type:
    ui-name : |
      Data Type
    short-hint : |
      Should CuffDiff be run on the gene or transcript level?
  output_obj_name :
    ui-name : |
      Differential Expression Matrix Set Object Name
    short-hint : |
      Provide the name of the differential expression analysis output
  library_norm_method:
      ui-name : |
          Library Normalization Method
      short-hint : |
          Select how library sizes (sequencing depths) are normalized in Cufflinks and Cuffdiff. By default, no scaling is applied to FPKM.
  multi_read_correct :
      ui-name : |
          Multi Read Correct
      short-hint : |
          Do an initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads mapping to multiple locations in the genome.
  time_series :
      ui-name : |
          Time Series
      short-hint : |
          Analyze the provided samples as a time series, rather than testing for differences between all pairs of samples.
  min_alignment_count :
      ui-name : |
          Minimum alignments
      short-hint : |
          The minimum number of fragment alignments in a locus needed for a significance test on changes in that locus observed between samples. The default is 10.

description : |
    <p>This method uses the Cufflinks transcripts for two or more samples to calculate gene and transcript levels in more than one condition and finds significant changes in the expression levels.</p>
    <p>Internally, it uses Cuffmerge to merge multiple Cufflinks generated annotation files. If more than two BAM files are provided, Cuffdiff tests for differential expression between all pairs of samples.</p>

    <p>Cuffdiff calculates the FPKM value of each transcript, primary transcript and gene in each sample and produces a number of output files zipped in Cuffdiff output object.</p>
    <p>The Cuffdiff output can be further analyzed and visualized using methods such as 'Create Expression Matrix from Cuffdiff' and 'View CummeRbund Plots'.</p>

    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a> and is not intended to run standalone.</p>
