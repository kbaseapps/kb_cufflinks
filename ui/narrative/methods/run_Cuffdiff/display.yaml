parameters :
  expressionset_ref :
    ui-name : |
      Expression Set
    short-hint : |
      Select the expression set associated with transcripts assembled by Cufflinks or Stringtie.
  input_type:
    ui-name : |
      Data Type
    short-hint : |
      Should CuffDiff be run on the gene or transcript level?
  output_obj_name :
    ui-name : |
      Differential Expression Matrix Set
    short-hint : |
      Provide the name of the differential expression analysis output object.
  library_norm_method:
      ui-name : |
          Library Normalization Method
      short-hint : |
          Select how library sizes (sequencing depths) are normalized in Cufflinks and Cuffdiff. By default, no scaling is applied to FPKM.
  multi_read_correct :
      ui-name : |
          Multi Read Correct
      short-hint : |
          Do an initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads mapping to multiple locations in the genome.
  time_series :
      ui-name : |
          Time Series
      short-hint : |
          Analyze the provided samples as a time series, rather than testing for differences between all pairs of samples.
  min_alignment_count :
      ui-name : |
          Minimum alignments
      short-hint : |
          The minimum number of fragment alignments in a locus needed for a significance test on changes in that locus observed between samples. The default is 10.

description : |
    <p>This App takes as input the read alignments and assembled transcripts corresponding to two or more conditions and reports genes and transcripts which are differentially expressed under different conditions. More specifically, it generates a set of differential expression matrices for selected or all pairwise condition combinations as chosen by the user.</p>

    <p>The App also generates a zipped output file that contains FPKM tracking, count tracking, read group tracking and differential expression files for transcripts, CDSes, and genes for each condition.</p>

    <p>The Cuffdiff output can be further analyzed as up and down regulated features and associated expression matrices by the downstream App “Create Up/Down Regulated FeatureSet and ExpressionMatrix”.</p>
